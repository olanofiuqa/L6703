  get-module  -listavailable     =   list of install/available snapins 
  import-module -name ActiveDirectory    =   import the module
  get-command -module activedirectpry   = list of avaiable commands
  get-help get-* *

   get-help *module* = microsoft respository (PSGallery)
   
		Find-Module = one first use requires nuget download
